      <p>In the vast landscape of mortality rates tracked by the CDC from 2018 to 2021, one pattern is apparent above the rest: The significant difference in total deaths between two distinct age groups, 15 to 24 and 65 to 74, especially in the South. This immense discrepancy, escalated by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, has changed the understanding of healthcare dynamics and mortality rates through the tracking of data. </p>

      <p>While the data exemplifies a huge impact on the south in the number of deaths, the data also shows that the midwest was the most impacted when looking solely at crude rates. This is because the population of the midwest is smaller than the south, overall taking a bigger toll on the midwest’s population. </p>

      <p>The crude rates for the data are based on every 100,000 people. When comparing the crude death rates, the northeast had 27.8% fewer deaths than the midwest, and the midwest was 3.7% higher than the south when looking at crude rates. </p>

      <p>In addition to regional population and crude rates, comparing the data of the two 10-year age groups shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a testament to age-specific vitality. When the data started to be tracked in 2018, mortality rates across different age groups were relatively stable. Looking at the data beyond the pandemic, it is clear that mortality rates are influenced by a myriad of factors beyond just age.</p>



      <iframe title="Total Deaths of People Ages 65-74 between 2018 and 2021" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-5n8bs" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5n8bs/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

      <p>In specifically the Southern region, mortality rates increased by 10.4% between 2020 and 2021 for the people ages 65 to 74. Beyond the aggressive spike that occurred from the pandemic, this data table also shows that the Southern region had much higher mortality rates to start with. The other three regions started off close in numbers of death for this specific age group, all below 122,000. However, the South was almost double that, with mortality rates starting at 227,037 in 2018. According to Georgetown University’s School of Health, 48% of COVID-19 deaths were in the South since October 2020, which makes up 38% of the population, pointing to disproportionate outcomes regionally.</p>

      <p>“Our study is the first to quantify avoidable deaths and confirm that both COVID-19 deaths and avoidable deaths disproportionately occurred in the South,” said Michael Stoto, professor of Health Systems Administration and Population Health and corresponding author of the study in a <a href="https://health.georgetown.edu/news-story/higher-covid-19-death-rates-in-the-southern-u-s-due-to-behavior-differences/">Georgetown University article.</a> </p>

      <p>However, the discrepancy of deaths in the South provokes questioning of what makes the South more susceptible to mortality. Through several studies and observations, it was found that there are several reasons as to why the South’s mortality rates are so high. While the south is commonly known for being composed of red states, researchers from Yale University found that the excess death rate among Republican voters was 43% higher than the excess death rate among Democratic voters after vaccine eligibility was opened. An <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/12/05/1059828993/data-vaccine-misinformation-trump-counties-covid-death-rate"> NPR analysis</a> gathered in late 2020 that people in regions that voted strongly for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election were "nearly three times as likely to die from COVID-19" as people in pro-Biden regions.</p>

      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/center-for-policy-research/people/faculty/xue-zhang">Xue Zhang</a>, a Lerner Postdoctoral Scholar in Population Health at the Syracuse University Center for Policy Research, Zhang concluded from the data that states with a higher percentage of minority population had a higher COVID-19 mortality rate. Regions that have a higher need for essential workers are more likely to be in contact with a virus like COVID-19. Zhang’s personal research on social determinants of health in rural-urban differences used the Fundamental Cause Theory to support her findings. 
</p>

      <p>“The Fundamental Cause Theory shows that socioeconomic conditions are related to health outcomes,” Zhang said. “My research analyzes the relationships between socioeconomic vulnerability and mortality. People with higher socioeconomic status have more access to power, knowledge, and healthcare services, overall putting them at a lower risk for death from COVID-19.”

      <!-- EXAMPLE OF A DATAWRAPPER EMBED --> 

     <iframe title="Total Deaths of People Ages 15-24 between 2018 and 2021" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-S29fI" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/S29fI/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>


      <p>While this data table deep dives into the mortality rates of people ages 15 to 24, the evidence shows that mortality rates were almost 182% lower than people ages 65-74 from 2018-2021. This is because the younger population is less likely to develop severe diseases because aging is minimal in young adults and accelerates in later years, as per the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7799091/#:~:text=Younger%20populations%20have%20fewer%20of,likelihood%20of%20developing%20severe%20disease.">National Library of Medicine</a>. According to the National Library of Medicine, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, kidney failure, cancer and heart disease all become more prevalent as populations age, and evidence indicates that each can contribute to a poor outcome in individuals infected with COVID.</p>

      <p>Lauraine Kanders, a Lead Nurse Practitioner, noticed many more elders suffering from COVID-19 than the younger population while working at Ennoble Care.</p>

      <p>“The people who were most at risk for complications and death were males over 64 and those with hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and hyperlipidemia,” Kanders said. “Between one month and one year after infection, 1 in 5 aged 18-64 develop a medical condition secondary to COVID. Among those greater than 65 years old, 1 in 4 have a condition related to COVID. You can see that the older population are clearly at greater risk for this.”</p>

      <p>Looking back at both data tables, regardless of the age group, every region except for the south had a plateau in death rates. According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-us-deep-south-poverty-race-perfect-storm">Mayo Clinic</a>, vaccines for COVID-19 started to be released in December of 2020, and the graphs above show that post-release, death rates were mostly at a standstill. However, in the South, where many did not believe in getting vaccinated due to political views, death rates continued to increase. While the underlying cause of this influx of deaths is not confirmed to be COVID-related, it is clear in the data that the time period of COVID-19 heavily affects the outcome of the data tables.</p>
